# Decision Trees classifiers, ML
Construction of classifiers from scratch using ID3 and Random Forest as algorithms.<br/>
Construction of said classifiers using the same algorithms, but now making use of Scikit-Learn implementations.<br/>
Evaluation and comparison between what was implemented from scratch and what was obtained with Scikit-Learn.<br/>
The learning success is measured through the evaluation of the classifiers on an evaluation set, which is obtained from the previous partition of the dataset.<br/>
The detailed explanation of the project is in the lab "decision-trees-lab".
